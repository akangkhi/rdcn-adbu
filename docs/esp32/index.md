### Why ESP32?

- ESP32 has a faster CPU of 240MHz, and comes in a dual core configuration, thats 2 x 240MHz.
- It has inbiult WiFi and Bluetooth, and handles the TCP/IP Stack without any extra hardware configurations.
- It is the only microcontroller thats cheap, fast and has a lot of connectivity options.
- It also comes in a packages that makes PCB assembly easy.
- It has a huge number of GPIO, which is usefull in connecting a faster display.


### ESP32 Applications

- ESP32 is used in most IoT applications that required both WiFi and BLuetooth functionalities.
- The last two years has see a surge in ESP32 in applications covering many domains.
- The faster processor enables to drive a high resolution colour display, and the huge IO makes it possible to connect a lot of peripheral.
- The Dual core benefits in creating multithreaded applications that runs at the same time, and delivers twice the output.
